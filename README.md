# Visual Time 

**Note:** Inispired from Kalle Hallden's [time magement project](https://github.com/KalleHallden/Time-management-app) 

An advanced, minimalist and powerful time management application. Where you can create task, give it a duration, and select which week days you wanna do it.
By doing this you can easily manage a whole week or a concrete day. Application sets "Today" automatically. And you can see your 24 hours as a circle which is divided by tasks. Also you can see the task's duration by tapping the divided item on day circle. Application has light and dark theme, and supports four language: *"English, Turkish, Russian, and Georgian"*.
